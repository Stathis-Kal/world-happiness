# Welcome

In this **Jupyter** notebook I will explore the *happiness* levels of **Greece**, during the period from 2015 to 2019.

I will use Python for data analysis and data visualization. More specifically I will use these Python Libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Folium

## Datasets

The happiness scores and rankings use data from the [Gallup World Poll](https://www.gallup.com/analytics/247355/gallup-world-happiness-report.aspx).

The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the **best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale**.

The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of **six factors** – *economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity* – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in [Dystopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia), a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.
